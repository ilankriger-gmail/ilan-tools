# Solving for Market Awareness

<div><b><h2>Solving for Market Awareness</h2></b></div>
<div>There's different levels of market awareness. And different levels must be spoken to in different ways.</div>
<div>Remember, you want to meet the reader where they are.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Do they know about your product? They’re <b>Product Aware</b><br></div>
<div>Do they know there’s a solution to the problem (but not your product)? They’re <b>Solution Aware</b><br></div>
<div>Do they know they have a problem (but not about any solutions)? They’re <b>Problem Aware</b><br></div>
<div>Do they not even realise they have a problem (but still feel some pain)? They’re <b>Unaware</b><b><br></b></div>
<div><b><br></b></div>
<div>&quotIf your prospect] is aware of your product and realizes it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with your product. If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned only with the general problem, your headline starts with that problem and crystallizes it into a specific need.&quot<br></div>
