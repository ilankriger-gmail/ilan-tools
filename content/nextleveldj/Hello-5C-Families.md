<div><b>I hope you are doing well. If you are receiving this email, it means your child did not turn in one or more of the following assignments. Please make sure they complete them over the weekend and submit them on Toddle before Monday.</b></div>
<div><b>Description Paragraph: Students should already have this completed, as it is the first paragraph of their ecosystem writing. They need to download it as a PDF and upload it to the assignment. This paragraph will be graded on organization of text.</b></div>
<div><b>Sequence Paragraph: Students should already have this as well, as it is the second paragraph, explaing a food web,  of their ecosystem writing. They need to download it as a PDF and upload it to the assignment. This paragraph will be graded on conventions.</b></div>
<div><b>Finding the Area of Rectangles with Fractional Side Lengths: There are 5 slides where students need to find the side lengths of the rectangles and multiply them to find the area of the shaded region.</b></div>
